# Copy Paste Developer

A fun little Visual Studio Code extension by **Muhammad Hanan** 🎉  

This extension helps developers smile while coding.  
Whenever you paste a big chunk of code (more than **50 words** across multiple lines),  
you’ll get a playful message reminding you to **“Cool down bro, use less ChatGPT… hehehe 😅”**.  

It’s meant as a **stress-reliever** and to add a bit of humor to your daily workflow.
