# Copy Paste Developer

A fun little Visual Studio Code extension by **Muhammad Hanan** 🎉  

This extension helps developers smile while coding.  
Whenever you paste a big chunk of code (more than **100 words** across multiple lines),  
you’ll get a playful bilingual reminder:  

**"😅 Thak gaye ho copy–paste karke… ye lo paani pee lo 🥤 (Tired of copy–pasting? Here, have some water 🥤)"**

It’s meant as a **stress-reliever** and to add a bit of humor to your daily workflow.
